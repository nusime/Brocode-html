          Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
          Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah, ah
          I bought you things that I didn't even have the money for
          If I could make you feel so rich, I don't mind feeling poor
          There's something 'bout you so addictive, had me needing more
          Yeah, I just wanna hold you
          Baby, you the one I want
          I know I've said this all before but I'll say it again
          You the only one I want and girl, I can't pretend
          I remember cloudy days, we cuddled in my bed
          The thought of losing you just makes no sense inside my head
          You the reason I believe that love is real
          Ain't nobody make me feel the way you make me feel
          Darling, tell me, is it real?
          Or was I lying to myself just to make it feel so real?
          Ain't nobody gon' love you like I love you
          Ain't nobody gon' want you like I want you
          Ain't nobody gon' trust you like I trust you
          Ain't nobody gon', ain't nobody gon'
          Ain't nobody gon' love you like I love you
          Ain't nobody gon' trust you like I trust you
          Ain't nobody gon' want you like I want you
          Ain't nobody gon' wanna no no no
          I can't love nobody anymore
          You the only one that I ever want
          I compare her to you, she has never won
          Now I wanna just be all alone
          Nobody love me like you
          And I can't love nobody back
          You remind me of the moon
          'Cause every night you coming back
          What am I supposed to do?
          If I'm so in love with you
          I can not get over you
          I can not get over you
          Since you left me, every night, I go stare at the moon
          Wishing it was you and I, that's something we would do
          Every Sunday morning, I go watch the flowers bloom
          I do things we used to do, hoping I'll run into you
          What's a lie and what's the truth
          I can not get over you
          Doesn't matter what I do
          Everyone just looks like you
          Girl, I smell you everywhere
          Smell your perfume and your hair
          I try to act like I don't care
          Everyone knows (that I care)
          You the reason I believe that love is real (love is real)
          Ain't nobody make me feel, the way you make me feel
          Darling, tell me is it real?
          Or was I lying to myself just to make it feel so real?
          Ain't nobody gon' love you like I love you
          Ain't nobody gon' want you like I want you
          Ain't nobody gon' trust you like I trust you
          Ain't nobody gon', ain't nobody gon', no
          Ain't nobody gon' love you like I love you
          Ain't nobody gon' trust you like I trust you
          Ain't nobody gon' want you like I want you
          Ain't nobody gon', ain't nobody gon'
          Trust you, like I trust you
          Ain't nobody gon'
          Love you like I love you
          Ain't nobody gon, la, la, love you
          Ain't nobody gon'
          Ain't nobody gon'</pre>

        I remember to remember life is a bitch
        So, no, I could never kiss-n-tell
        And wish me well 'cause life is hell
        And double the C 'cause a nigga only care about Chanel
        I been knockin' knees with birds and bees
        Been overseas with bitches who don't speak English well
        Like a owl, who?
        The only enemy here is you, uh
        Like bling, blow, kapoof
        Fairly Odd Fairy 'done stole my tooth
        No cap on cat, no Dr. Seuss
        Eat flapjacks, double cup of syrup too
        'Cause I only want the neck like a noose on goose
        And I'm only wildin' out when I'm loose off Goose
        Ayy, pull up on 'em, hey, make 'em run, hey, yuh, ayy

Never say never
Pick it up, pick, pick, pick it up
Pick it up, pick, pick, pick it up
Yeah, yeah, never ever, ever, ever, ever
See, I never thought that I could walk through fire (eh)
I never thought that I could take the burn (eh)
I never had the strength to take it higher (eh)
Until I reached the point of no return (eh)
And there's just no turning back (back)
When your heart's under attack (attack)
Gonna give everything I have
It's my destiny
I will never say never, I will fight
I will fight 'til forever, to make it right
Whenever you knock me down
I will not stay on the ground
Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up, pick it up, up, up
And never say never
Ne-never say never
Ne-never say never
Ne-never say never
Never say it, never, never say it
I never thought that I could feel this power (eh)
I never thought that I could feel this free (eh)
I'm strong enough to climb the highest tower (yeah)
And I'm fast enough to run across the sea (oh, oh)
'Cause there's just no turning back (oh no)
When your heart's under attack (oh no)
Gonna give everything I have
'Cause this is my destiny
I will never say never, I will fight (never say never)
I will fight 'til forever, to make it right
Whenever you knock me down
I will not stay on the ground
Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up, pick it up, up, up
And never say never
Here we go, guess who?
J Smith and JB, uh-huh
I gotcha lil' bro, I can handle them
Hold up, aight? I can handle them
Now he's bigger than me, taller than me
And he's older than me, and stronger than me
And his arms a little bit longer than me
But he ain't on a JB song with me
I be trying to chill, they be trying to sour the thrill
No pun intended, was raised by the power of Will
Like Luke with the force, if push comes to shove
Like Kobe in the 4th, ice water for blood, let's go
I gotta be the best, and yes, we're the flyest
Like David and Goliath, I conquered the giant
So now I got the world in my hand
I was born from two stars, so the moons where I land (I'm gone)
I will never say never (never say it, never, never say it), I will fight
I will fight 'til forever, to make it right
Whenever you knock me down
I will not stay on the ground
Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up, pick it up, up, up
And never say never (never say never)
I will never say never (never say it, never, never say it)
Never say never
I will fight to forever to make it right
Whenever you knock me down
I will not stay on the ground
Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up, pick it up, up, up
And never say never
Ne-never say never (never say it)
Ne-never say never (never say it)
Ne-never say never (never say it)
And never say never (say never)
Ne-never say never (never say it)
Ne-never say never (no, no, never say it)
Ne-never say never
And never say never
